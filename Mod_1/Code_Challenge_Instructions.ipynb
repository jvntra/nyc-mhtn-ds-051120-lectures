    "- Students are allowed to use the static internet resources, notes, or past labs/READMEs\n",
    "- Students are not allowed to copy/paste code. While this may not be enforceable, we can set - the expectation that students should be able to write the code from scratch in the time available, using existing code as reference\n",
    "- Part of the assessment is interpreting the questions correctly, so proctors will not answer questions about the content of the challenge \n",
    "- Students should submit their PRs before the end of the 90 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proctoring \n",
    "We will put you in separate break out rooms in which you will share your screen while completing the assessment. We will let you know at when there are 60 minutes, 30 mins, 15 mins, and 5 mins left to complete the assessment. You can ask for help by sending proctorers a private message or raise hand in Zoom. \n",
